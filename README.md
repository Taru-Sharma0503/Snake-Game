# Snake Game in Python 🐍🍎

## Introduction
This is a fun and interactive Snake Game built using Python and Pygame. In this game, you control a snake that moves around the screen collecting apples 🍎 while avoiding the edges of the game window. The snake rotates according to the direction you move it, and your score increases each time an apple is eaten 🎯. The game ends when the snake hits the screen boundaries, displaying a “GAME OVER” message. The game also features a custom background image and icons to make the gameplay visually appealing. Use the arrow keys ⬆️⬇️⬅️➡️ to control the snake. This project is a great way to learn the basics of Pygame, event handling, collision detection, and simple game mechanics in Python.

## How to Run ▶️

Make sure Python is installed on your system.

Install Pygame if not already installed:

pip install pygame


Place the script along with the required images (snake_icon.png, snake_image.png, apple.png, bg_image.jpg) in the same folder.

Run the game with:

python snake_game.py


Control the snake using arrow keys and try to eat as many apples as possible while avoiding the edges of the screen.
